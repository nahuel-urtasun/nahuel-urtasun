## About me
I'm an IT Support Specialist with a passion for solving tech challenges and breaking down complex issues into simple solutions. Whether itâ€™s troubleshooting or handling more advanced technical problems, I focus on helping people cut through confusion to find clear, effective answers.

Currently, I am expanding my skill set through the Globant Code Your Future sponsorship program, specializing in Backend Development with Java and Spring Framework. I also have a basic understanding of Python (including libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib) as well as JavaScript with React, HTML, and CSS. I'm always working to improve my skills and stay prepared for new challenges.
